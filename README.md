# INFOEA Assignments 1 & 2
Last updated: 2014-12-27

### Implementation

This is my implementation for assignments 1 and 2 in the Evolutionary Computation course at UU.

The assignment compares the performance of uniform crossover, 2-point crossover, and mutation on 6 different kinds of fitness functions. In all cases, the optimal solution is a binary string of all ones.

### Building the code

Make sure Go is installed and you have set the path correctly. Then simply run `go build` to build the project. The plots can be generated using the gnuplot scripts after running the experiments (eg. `plot1.gpi > plot1.png`).
